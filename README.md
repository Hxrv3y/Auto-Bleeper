To make sure this works make sure you have speech_recognition installed which can be insalled in your command prompt with "pip install SpeechRecognition"

This kinda works its quite delayed when you say the said swear word was looking on trying to make it real time but couldnt get it to work if you know any other way then make a pull request or fork this your self

to add more words just add a comma to the last swear word and add speech marks. Pretty simple pretty easy, done.
